# tsheatmap

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of tsheatmap is to create an easy visualisations of timeseries as a heatmap with respect to the nature of repetitive patterns in calendaric phases like week, days, and hours. Most of our behaviour is related to the date, day of the week and hour. The type of visualisation respects that and will make repetitice patterns over the course of a year visible.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of tsheatmap from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("tsheatmap") -->
<!-- ``` -->


You can install the development version of tsheatmap from Github by

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("NanisTe/tsheatmap",ref = "dev")

```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to plot a dataset:

```{r example}
library(tsheatmap)
## basic example code

df <- 
  data.frame(
    Datetime = seq.POSIXt(from = as.POSIXct("2019-01-01",tz = "Europe/Zurich")
                          ,to = as.POSIXct("2019-12-31 23:00",tz = "Europe/Zurich")
                          ,by = "1 hour"),
    Data = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,1,3,5,7,9,7,5,4,3,2,1,0))

tsheatmap(data = df
          , datetime_colname = "Datetime"
          , data_colname = "Data")

tsheatmap(data = df[1:8713,]
          , data_colname = "Data")

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
